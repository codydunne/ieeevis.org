The VIS Restructuring Committee was tasked in 2016 by the VEC (VIS Executive Committee) with considering alternative structures, such as a more unified conference, that may better enhance vibrancy and growth. It has generated the following documents:

* [VIS Restructuring Recommendations, Fall 2018](http://ieeevis.org/governance/1810-Restructuring-Recommendations.pdf)
* [VIS Restructuring Workshop Executive Summary, Fall 2018](http://ieeevis.org/governance/1809-Restructuring-Workshops-Executive-Summary.pdf)
* [VIS Restructuring Workshops Summary, Fall 2018](http://ieeevis.org/governance/1810-Restructuring-Workshops-Summary.pdf)
* [VIS Restructuring Feedback, January 2018](http://ieeevis.org/governance/1801-Restructuring-Feedback.pdf)
* [VIS Restructuring Report ("Phoenix Report"), Fall 2017](http://ieeevis.org/governance/170925-Restructuring-Slides.pdf)

The post-PhD early career researchers of the VIS community crafted an [open letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16zV8BQ_7vCiILlEyy2ufJFcoVPH7WPrIyE6THMQ99bw/) in response to the "VIS for the Future" session at VIS 2018 and the "VIS Restructuring Recommendations, Fall 2018". The letter recognizes and applauds the efforts of the "VIS Restructuring Committee" and seeks to emphasizes points that we believe are particularly crucial for our success at this stage of our careers.
